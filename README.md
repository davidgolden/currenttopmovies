<h1>Current Top Movies App</h1>

<p>This is my first React JS application. It was created using the <a href='https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app'>Create React App</a> boilerplate and built in React and vanilla CSS. It utilizes <a href='https://www.themoviedb.org/'>TheMovieDB API</a> and <a href='https://github.com/cavestri/themoviedb-javascript-library/'>themoviedb-javascript-library</a> npm package for data retrieval.</p>
